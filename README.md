MRRP: Map Race Reading Points 
This is a tool for the Forest Race, a minigame in the community of Scrap Clicker 2. I made it (within 5-6 hours) during Season 8 to make updating the scores easier, as the increased complexity of points and huge increase of activity caused it to start taking a long time. With this, it's around 2x faster, and a lot more comfortable. 

I made this for myself, but people can check out how it works
